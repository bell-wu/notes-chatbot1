FTTA Notes chatbot

The Full-time Training in Anaheim is a two-year Bible truth and service school located in Anaheim, California. It is referred to as the FTTA or sometimes simply "the training."

The two-year program is split into four terms (semesters). You can call the students in each term a first termer, second termer, third termer, and fourth termer. In my notes, the four terms are denoted T1, T2, T3, and T4. 

Some of the classes and their abbreviations: 
WOG - Word of God
BOC1 - Body of Christ (1)
BOC2 - Body of Christ (2)
ECAL1 - Experience of Christ as Life (1)
ECAL2 - Experience of Christ as Life (2)
FM - Full Ministry of Christ
