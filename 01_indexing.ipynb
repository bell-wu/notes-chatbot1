When it lives by its characteristics, it is blessed. It is so crucial for us as believers to have the meetings. Any meeting of the church must be initiated by the Lord, not by ourselves.\\n\\t\\t- John G: We are gathered into the name of the Lord Jesus. The reality and name of the Lord Jesus is in the Holy Spirit. Now we come to the Lord\\'s table. We\\'ve been redeemed by the Lord\\'s death. So we should all go to the Lord\\'s table. The table of the Lord signifies man\\'s enjoyment for God. The Lord\\'s supper is for the Lord\\'s enjoyment. Both God and man enjoy.\\n\\t\\t- Abby: The second part of the table is to worship the Father. We first receive the Lord, then we draw near to the Father (the experience of the believers). The Lord sang a hymn to the Father. We see this also in ((b058c002-a012-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). This verse reveals the resurrected Christ sings hymns of praise in the midst of the church. We should never neglect the worship of the Father. We just follow the Son in taking the lead among the many sons to worship the Father.\\n\\t\\t- Julien: Prayer meetings: binding and loosing. Also in one accord. This is not just one in mind, but one in spirit and one in mind, emotion, and will. One in will ((b044c001-a014-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). Also for spiritual warfare ((b044c012-a005-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)).\\n\\t\\t- Nick: Edifying the saints through the spiritual gifts ((b046c014-a026-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). Has, implying possession, or wielding something for power (Gk.). This life carries with it all the divine capacities to build itself up. An important aspect of this. meeting is that it\\'s in mutuality. Each one has. If they don\\'t have this gift, then there\\'s a shepherd-teacher to cultivate them that they function to build up the Body of Christ.\\n\\t\\t- Rebecca: A proper church meeting must be unique in two things. Mutuality and speaking. A speaking that is positive, nourishing, and edifying. Everyone has a portion; not just the speaking of one or two. Relying on others to pray or call a hymn is relying on a tradition that kills the Body of Christ. Mutuality is a way that God invented and ordained. This is God\\'s ordained way and no one can turn from it or improve it. We need to turn from the traditional way of having one or a few speakers. Should also be kept in peace. This means that the meeting should be kept in good order. God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. This is according to the order and peace that God Himself is. ((b046c014-a033-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1))\\n\\t\\t- Moriah: Testifying the Headship of Christ and covering women. For them to be silent in the meetings does not mean they cannot prophesy. We can see many cases in Acts where women were recorded prophesying. This is altogether under God\\'s governmental ordination. The fourth kind of meeting is for reading the word of God. Fifth is gathering to listen to messages.\\n\\t\\t- Christy: Gathered into the Lord\\'s presence, in the Lord\\'s name. The name denotes the person. The person of the Lord Jesus is the Spirit. When we link ... we need to call on the Lord in the meetings. To meet together is to be gathered into the person of the Lord, which is gathered into the Spirit. This gathering will gather us out of all preoccupations and into the Lord. In such a spirit, we can gather together for a church meeting.\\n\\t\\t- Mercy S: House to house. We all can and have something for Christ.\\n\\t- Opening Word\\n\\t\\t- It\\'s critical that we talk about meetings as we practice the church life, because meetings are such an integral part of the church life. Even the Greek word for church, *ekklesia*, means **the gathering of the called ones.** So of course, we need to gather. We need to see in the New Testament what ways God has ordained for us to gather.\\n\\t\\t- And the meetings are also critical because the meetings enable the believers to be **supplied, established, and perfected**. So that God\\'s goal can be accomplished. The meetings are also an **ordination** from God to the believers.\\n\\t\\t- In the Old Testament, congregation. In the New Testament, we even have the clear commandment not to abandon our assembling together. As you just heard, ((b058c010-a025-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)) exhorts us not to forsake the assembling ourselves together. **This is our law of existence and blessing, the church meetings.** We, just like fish need water, cows eat grass, us believers need meetings. Very simple law.\\n\\t\\t- This was deeply impressed on me as a young believer. I was with some saints who had migrated from Austin to College Station, to establish the church life there. One brother, Gordon, was just a special brother. Every time you got with him, he just had some fresh enjoyment, and you got watered and fresh oil. He was there, it was so good having him with us. And then at a certain point, he contracted some disease, where no one could visit him because he was highly contagious (for about a month). And so near the end of the month, we heard all of a sudden Gordon and his wife were packing their things, moving home back to Austin. I had not heard from him since. What we learned from that is that **it doesn\\'t matter how strong you are, who you are, how spiritual you are. If you don\\'t have meetings, fellowship with the saints, your spiritual life can not be sustained.** You are in extreme danger of going down. That\\'s exactly what happened. Of course, many of us were regretful, we didn\\'t reach out to call him. We could\\'ve at least done that. But it was just so shocking that someone like that all of a sudden gave up. But while he was in the meetings, he was feeling great. So I was very impressed we cannot forsake our assembling together. #personaltestimonies And at least now we have zoom. But we need to reach out to the saints, if they\\'re ill or unable to meet. Because you need the meetings.\\n\\t\\t- Sheep need a flock. One shepherd, one flock. We gather together because it is the nature of the sheep life not to be in isolation but to flock together with the other sheep. This is our experience. We just enjoy flocking together, being with other sheep. Enjoying our life together as the one flock.\\n\\t\\t- And a companion message to this, Brother Nee has a series on messages for new believers. He points out some principles there that are helpful regarding the need for the meetings: \"**A Christian can never substitute meetings with self-taught pursuit.** God has a category of grace reserved for the meetings only. If we don\\'t meet with others, that portion of particular grace will not be available to us. We receive answers to prayers. We often receive no light individually, but when we come to the meetings, we find light. What we find individually in our own pursuit can never match what we find in the meetings.\" This is true.\\n\\t\\t- His glory broke out upon us when we were in the church. Thank the Lord for the meetings.\\n\\t- A.\\n\\t\\t- Meetings are firstly a gathering of the believers by the Lord into His name.\\n\\t\\t- A few weeks ago we talked about ((b043c003-a016-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)) in the WMM. Believe *into* His name. The word is \"into\" because we\\'re not just believe in the teaching of a person, but we\\'re entering into that person. Likewise, we\\'re gathered into the Lord\\'s name. That means to be gathered into a person. The person today is a Spirit. **Whenever we meet, we are gathered into the Lord\\'s name, into the Person, into the Spirit.**\\n\\t\\t- ((b040c018-a020-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). Gathered is in the passive voice. Meaning that we don\\'t initiate the gathering. But every time we meet, it should be the Lord Himself who gathers. Apparently it is us, but it is the Lord who initiates every meeting. **We should allow ourselves to be gathered into the Lord Himself.**\\n\\t\\t- We are rescued from all kinds of worldly distractions and occupations. All kinds of things can hold us if we\\'re not in the Lord\\'s name. So **we need to be gathered into and out of**. There are all kinds of things we need to be gathered out of.\\n\\t\\t- **We especially need to be gathered out of the self.** If you\\'re in your self, you won\\'t enjoy the meeting. You need to be gathered into Him. Every meeting should be an escape from all other things into the Lord Himself. This is a principle, that we would be gathered out of everything else into the Lord Himself.\\n\\t\\t- The Lord promises us two kinds of presents in the gospel of Matthew. One is in ((b040c018-a020-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)), there am I. We have His presence. Then at the end of Matthew, ((b040c028-a019-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1))-20. This is the Lord\\'s promise to be with us individually. **So we have the promise of the Lord being with us individually and corporately. But the promise of the Lord being with us corporately is far greater than what we can enjoy individually.** There\\'s no way we can fulfill God\\'s purpose as individuals. We need corporate gatherings.\\n\\t- Lord\\'s table meeting\\n\\t\\t- ((b044c020-a007-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). When we gathered together to break bread. Three terms used **interchangeably**: bread-breaking meeting, Lord\\'s table, and Lord\\'s supper. Here, it says the apostles practiced the bread-breaking meeting on the first day of the week. In 1 cor. 11, it mentions the Lord\\'s supper; in ch. 10, it mentions the Lord\\'s table.\\n\\t\\t- It\\'s the first day, the day of the Lord\\'s resurrection, the beginning of a new week. It\\'s wonderful that **we can start each new week by having the Lord\\'s table meeting**. We enjoy the Lord, are occupied alone with the Lord. We are also hopefully clearing up everything that was any kind of a frustration between anyone, any kind of difference between believers. We need to see forgiveness and apologize if necessary. So that there is nothing between us. So that we can take the Lord\\'s table in a clear way. This is a great way to start the week. **It\\'s the Lord\\'s ordination, that every week we would come together like this.**\\n\\t\\t- The difference between the Lord\\'s table and the Lord\\'s supper. Strictly speaking, **the Lord\\'s table refers to the enjoyment of the Lord in fellowship**. Meaning that we enjoy the Lord in our joint participation, in our fellowship of Him. That\\'s for our satisfaction. On the other hand, **the Lord\\'s supper is for His satisfaction and for the remembrance of Him**.\\n\\t\\t- But quite often, we use these terms interchangeably, and we usually just say the Lord\\'s table. This is to be scripturally accurate. But there is the **mutuality**: we enjoy Him, He enjoys us; we satisfy Him, He satisfies us.\\n\\t- Two parts of the meeting.\\n\\t\\t- First, from ((b042c022-a019-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)), do this in remembrance of Me. And also from ((b046c011-a024-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1))-25. Paul is recounting that first Lord\\'s table. Do unto the remembrance of Me. Similarly also the cup. So **this meeting is to remember the Lord**. It is in accordance with the Lord\\'s charge to the disciples when He instituted the meeting. It\\'s not for anything else other than remembering the Lord. Everything should focus on His incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and exaltation, cause all members to remember the Lord Himself. We have so many hymns to remember the Lord. **The feeling of the meeting should be directed toward the Lord so that all can behold and remember Him.**\\n\\t\\t- The best hymns for the Lord\\'s table meeting are hymns that address the Lord in **first person**. Such as \"Dear Lord, as we consider Thee / We worship Thee for all Thou art.\" These are directed to the Lord to worship the Lord, and **these kinds of hymns bring out the proper feeling for the Lord\\'s table meeting**.\\n\\t\\t- There are a lot of other categories of hymns. There are hymns of exaltation, such as \"Let\\'s take the land, O Christian brothers.\" That\\'s good, but that\\'s not directed to the Lord. Likewise \"Fight the battle in the Body.\" It\\'s a great hymn, but not for the table. There are other hymns that express our longing for deeper operation of the Lord in us. But **the table meeting is not the time to ask the Lord to do anything.** Not the time to ask the Lord for some need of a person or place. All hymns should be directed to the Lord to remember the Lord.\\n\\t\\t- **In our praising of the Lord, we should follow our spirit, leading us to praise the Lord.** That means in the meeting, there is a flowing of the Spirit, leading us. Often a particular line or a **particular aspect** of the Lord. So sometimes, we may sing a hymn that\\'s more general of the Lord. Then another hymn may be called related to the Lord\\'s love. It\\'s like we hit a gusher, all kinds of praise for the Lord\\'s love. When that happens, we can sense that the Spirit has led us in that direction, to focus on that particular aspect of the Lord\\'s person.\\n\\t\\t- **Right after that, it\\'s not the time to call a hymn on another aspect of the Lord.** It\\'s better to stay on that line, as long as there is the anointing that is bring out the praise on that line. In other words, we sense a flow. We just need to stay in that flow until it moves in a different direction. Especially, the Lord\\'s table meeting is not the time to call our favorite hymn or a hymn we enjoyed the week before. We have to follow the sense. So that as the meeting goes on, it builds. It should be that the meeting reaches a certain peak, and everyone senses that this is the appropriate time to break the bread. But if we\\'re calling hymns that are all over the map, it\\'s unlikely that anyone can sense the meeting has gone in any direction or reached a peack.\\n\\t\\t- We also have another category of hymns that are even specifically for the Lord\\'s table meeting that point out to us the significance of the table and the elements of the table. One of those is #223. Read stanza 2. So many wonderful hymns like this that bring us into the significance of the table meeting, and **deepen our appreciation of what the Lord has done**. Thank the Lord He has given us so many rich hymns like this.\\n\\t\\t- **By attending the Lord\\'s table, we receive spiritual nourishment for our growth in life. We remember the Lord by eating and drinking of Him, and because of that, this is the one meeting that is not to be missed.**\\n\\t\\t- If you are in a situation where you are pressed on time (hopefully not for an extended period of time), and you can only make one meeting, make the Lord\\'s table meeting. Because that meeting will supply you, strengthen you, nourish you, in a way no other meeting can. And you will be sustained. Praise the Lord.\\n\\t\\t- The second section is to **worship the Father**. Also from the pattern of the Lord. This relates to the procedure of salvation: we receive the Lord, and then we come to the Father. Just like from ((b043c014-a006-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). Or as #49, come to the Father through Jesus the Son.\\n\\t\\t- In this section, all the prayers, hymns, and words should be directed toward the Father. This is from ((b040c026-a030-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). The Lord led them in singing hymns of praise to the Father. We also see this in ((b058c002-a012-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)), quoting Psalms. This is what happens in the second section of the Lord\\'s table meeting. The Lord is leading us to praise the Father. So it should be that every week in this meeting, **we follow the Lord in His leading to worship the Father**.\\n\\t\\t- When we worship the Father in singing hymns of praise, the firstborn Son **sings in our singing**. Just like in #50.\\n\\t\\t- **It\\'s wonderful we can have the Lord\\'s table week by week, and all be strengthened and supplied, and to offer the Lord the praise that He is due, and to come to the Father to offer our true worship to Him from our enjoyment of the Son.**\\n\\t- Gathering for prayer\\n\\t\\t- ((b040c018-a020-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)), obviously not an individual but a gathering of the saints.\\n\\t\\t- And we see the pattern of the saints in Acts. ((b044c001-a014-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). Here was a prayer in one accord. This one accord is stronger than what the Lord mentions in Matt. 18 about praying in agreement or harmony in having that prayer answered. A prayer in one accord means that we have the same mind and purpose. So clearly, they were there based on the Lord\\'s promise at the end of the book of Luke, for them to wait in Jerusalem until they receive power from on high. So they were praying for the pouring out of the economical Spirit, which occurred on the Day of Pentecost. That prayer was prayer in the one accord.\\n\\t\\t- Another kind of prayer in ((b044c004-a031-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). Peter and John persecuted by the Jewish religionists, and the church gathered together to pray. Through their prayer, their speaking only intensified. They began to speak the word with even more boldness. It\\'s very interesting that in that prayer, this is the first prayer that actually tells us in the New Testament what the content of their prayer was. If you look at this prayer, they were actually pray-reading from Psa. 2, about why to the heathen .. and people. **They were pray-reading that back to the Lord, in response to what had happened to Peter and John.** #pray-read It\\'s good to pray back to the Lord what He has spoken.\\n\\t\\t- We [also] see this in ((b044c012-a005-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). There was a gathering in a sister\\'s home, praying regarding Peter\\'s imprisonment and release. After he was miraculously released, he went to that home, the house of Mary, mother of John, where there were a considerable number praying. This kind of prayer meeting was primarily a gathering of sisters. And the sisters have a particular function of prayer. This prayer moved the heavens, shook the earth, and got Peter released, to get out of the prison and escape what was happening there, the persecution from Herod.\\n\\t\\t- But this was also a prayer of warfare. In our personal prayer, we can pour out our heart to the Lord, we can express our longing to Him. But it\\'s only when we gather together that we pray these prayers with authority, prayers of warfare. Prayers that bring about the execution of God\\'s will for His move on the earth. This was that kind of prayer. It was **primarily sisters**.\\n\\t\\t- **If you can show me a church that is strong and healthy, I assure you, there will be some sisters who gather together in that church to pray for the church.** Particularly, this is the function of older sisters. if that church has the prayer of such a group of sisters, that church will be under the Lord\\'s blessing and will be strong and healthy.\\n\\t- Gathering for edification by exercising the spiritual gifts\\n\\t\\t- This is what we call the prophesying meeting.\\n\\t\\t- First, in **mutuality**. It took a long time for us to be brought into such a practice. When Brother Lee came to this country in the 60s, America was very entrenched in traditional Christianity, in all its practices. One of the most outstanding of which is the practice of one man speaking. Because this was so entrenched in American Christianity, there just wasn\\'t the way to have a change, out of that system of one man speaking, into the kind of meeting spoken in ((b046c014-a026-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1)). Where each one prophesies, the opportunity for all the saints to function in mutuality. #churchhistory\\n\\t\\t- It is one of the strategies of the enemy, against the church, that he would annul all the function of the members. So **it\\'s crucial that there\\'d be in all our meetings a provision for all the saints to function**. If there\\'s just one man speaking, and all others passive, then the function of all the other members is killed. **We all have to be builders of the church. We all have to be those that minister life to one another. We all have to be those that speak for God and speak forth God.** Praise the Lord, at some point, this shift was turned, and we were brought into the practice of prophesying.\\n\\t\\t- The second major characteristic is that of **speaking**. We come together, we\\'re meeting in mutuality, meaning that we can all function, and we all function by speaking. Every proper church meeting should have these two characteristics, mutuality and speaking. Speaking must be **genuine, positive, nourishing, and edifying**. But if we rely on others, that is, we come and be passive, or if we replace others, both of those are something of degradation that annuls the function of the members of the Body.\\n\\t\\t- There are some who like to speak and be the main speaker. They like to have the attention. This is something of ambition. I assure you, some brothers had a hard time with this change, from one man speaking to all prophesying. But if you have that kind of ambition, if you want to dominate the meetings, then you are **depriving** others of their opportunity to function. On the other hand, if you come with **no intention** to function, this is not good either. But we should all open to the Lord regarding proper function in the prophesying meetings. If you\\'re someone who functions every single week, while others don\\'t have the opportunity, maybe you should consider yielding some time, so that others have the chance.\\n\\t\\t- Often times, we do have the chance, but we don\\'t take it. Because we consider what to speak, wonder does this really fit here, is this really significant enough? Maybe it won\\'t come out in the best way. **All these considerations. If you hesitate like this, you will be lost, and your function won\\'t come out.**\\n\\t\\t- So in the prophesying meeting, it\\'s better to **not hesitate**. When the Lord is urging you to speak, go ahead and speak. And trust the Lord that a prophet will come out. None of us ever gives a perfect prophesy, and you don\\'t sit down and think, I nailed it. You always think, that could have been better. But that\\'s okay. We are in the *practice* of prophesying.\\n\\t\\t- **If you speak something with the exercise of your spirit, with life, with content of the truth, the saints will be edified, and they will receive something.** Furthermore, they will all support you. No one is there critiquing anyone\\'s speaking. You know this. You see someone standing against their disposition to try to push out their spirit. When you see that, you\\'re fully supporting that person. You\\'re not looking for mistakes or inaccuracies, you\\'re just standing with them, in their spirit, fully supporting them.\\n\\t\\t- We should realize, when we speak, this is what the saints are doing for us. **They just want to gain the Christ from us. They want our portion of Christ.**\\n\\t\\t- **May the Lord save us from all our considerations about ourselves, about how well our speaking is going to come out, and just release what we have.** I assure you, the best meeting is one which you function. You go home filled with the Lord.\\n- [[Lesson Summary]] {{renderer :wordcount_}}\\n\\t- Having meetings is central to the Christian life. This is actually the ordination of the Lord to His believers. The church is simply the gathering of the called out ones, and as believers we have all been called by the Lord. Like sheep needing to flock together, meeting together is necessary for our going on as a Christian. To paraphrase brother Nee, a Christian can never substitute meetings with self-taught pursuit, no matter how spiritually strong one may be.\\n\\t- After coming to the meetings for a while, we may start finding that we are not comfortable in the meetings. We have to realize that it is the Lord gathering us together, and not ourselves, our willpower, or our social needs that are gathering us. Whenever we meet, we are actually gathered into the Lord\\'s name. This means that the Lord is in our presence, and that we are in His Person and in the Spirit. We are not gathering under any other name either.\\n\\t- The Lord not only gathers us together, but first gathers us out of many other things to gather us together. We need to be gathered out of and gathered together. We especially need to be gathered out of the self. If we are in our self, there is no way we will enjoy the meeting. Actually, our self is resistant to the Christian life, especially to the meeting life. If we allow the Lord to gather us, every meeting will actually be an escape. Additionally, there will be enjoyment and enlightenment, more than what we can have individually.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None),\n",
